Bullock cart from the hub of potters
loaded to the hilt with pots and containers
The cart is driven by Bangsi badan
who is accompanied by nephew Madan
The haat has come up on Friday
by Padma's banks in Bucksbury
After assembling all the goods,
Transaction is done by village folks
Bitter gourd, pointed gourd, radish and aubergine
Baskets, winnowing fans woven with cane
Flour, refined and whole grain, gram and mustard
Wrappers for winter fancily embroidered
Slotted woks, spoons and ladles,
city procured, cheap umbrellas.
Over the sugarcane jaggery filled pitcher
a swarm of flies hover
A bale of hay by the boat
farmers daughter brought to the ghat
Kanai who begs on the road by singing songs
is blind
Local boys by the ghat in the river splash about.
