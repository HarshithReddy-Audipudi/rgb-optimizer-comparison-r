And dear lady worship Shiva
Be of service to him
Shiva can provide you today
riches that make you king
Sitting on the skin of a tiger
Husband of Durga
On his left is seated Chandika Parvati

From his left, Durga said
glancing at Shiva

"Please buy us bangles made from conch shell,
We will go to the Raas fair"

"I am a beggar, where shall I get bangles
If you wish to wear bangles, go to your parents place"

"Well then, stay here and eat crap
I am headed to my parents place, taking Karthik and Ganesh with me"
